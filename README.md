### A nice and large clock application for Haiku

## What is this?

It's a large, Conky-inspired clock display intended to be a replicant! Although of course you can run it as an app as well.

## Compiling

This project is made using [Paladin](https://depot.haiku-os.org/#!/pkg/paladin/haikuports/2/0/-/-/1/x86_64) and should not have any dependencies outside the default install. Simply download the IDE, hit Compile in there, make sure the attributes are set properly, and you're good to go!

## Install notes

You might have to manually set the app signature to get the replicant to work. The signature should be `application/x-vnd.pnkp-HugeClock`.
